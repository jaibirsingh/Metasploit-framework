## What is Nessus
* Proprietary vulnerabilioty scanner developed by Tenable.
* Perform a vulnerability scan on a target system and import the Nessus results in to MSF for analysis and exploitation.
* It automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities and also provide the info like CVE code linked to the vulnerability.
* Free version (Nessus Essentials) allows to scan upto 16 IPs.

* **PRACTICAL**
* Download Nessus
* On Windows GUI can be used to install
* On Linux, Go to the folder in which the downloaded execuatble for the Nessus is located:

* Run the scan with Nessus GUI.

* `db_import` --> All the tools that can be imported
* `db_import /home.kali/Downloads/[name of the file saved in Nessus]`
* `hosts` --> Check if it is imported correctly. It should show our target machine.
* `services`
* `vulns` OR `vulns -p [port number]` --> For these vulns and services, we can search for the related exploits.
* `search cve:2017 name:smb` --> Look for exploits in CVE. OR
