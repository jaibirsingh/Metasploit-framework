### What are Windows Access Tokens
* A core element of the authentication process on Windows.
* Created and managed by Local Authority Subsytem Service (LSASS)
* It can be thought of as a temporary akin to a web cookie that provides access to a system or a network resource without having to provide credentials each time.
* **How are they generated**
  * Genereated the winlogon.exe process every time a user authenticates successfully
  * This toen is then attached to the userinit.exe process
  * Afte which all the child processes started by that user will inherit a copy of the access token and will run under the privileges of the same token.
 
* **Categories of Windows Access Tokens**
  * Impersonate
    * Created through a non-interactive login through specific system services or domain logons.
    * These tokens can be used to impersonate a token just on the local system and not on any external system, even though that system is using these tokens
   
  * Delegate
    * Created through a traditional login or through remote access protocols such as RDP.
    * These pose the largest threat as they cabe used to impersonate token on any system.

* **Windows privileges**   
* Impersonation depends on the privileges assigned to the account that has been gained during the exploitation phase
* For a successful impersonation:
  * **SeAssignPrimaryToken**
    * Allows a user to impersonate tokens.
   
  * **SeCreateToken**
    * Allows a user to create an arbitrary token with administrative privileges
   
  * **SeImpersonatePrivilege**
    * Allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with administrative privileges.
   
  * **Incognito Mode**
    * A built-in meterpreter module
    * Allows to impersonate user tokens after successful explitation
    * Used to display a list of available token that we can impersonate.
   
  * PRACTICAL
  * Repeat steps till db_nmap
  * `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
  * `sysinfo` --> to check if the meterpreter session is x64 or not.
  * **Escalate the privileges**
  * `load incognito`
  * `list_tokens -u`
  * Under "Delegation Token Available" --> We need to get the name of the token which we want to impersonate, to be used in the next step.
  * `impersonate_token "[name of delegation token]"`
  * `hashdump` --> Might throw an error because the current token must be associated to the previous less privileged user. So we have to change the process to solve this problem.
  * `ps`
  * Look for the PID of the process "explorer.exe"
  * `migrate [PID]`
