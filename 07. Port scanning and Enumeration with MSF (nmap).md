## What is nmap
* A free and open-source  netwrok scanner
* Discover hosts on a network + scan targets for open ports
* Enumerate services running on open ports + OS
* The results of nmpa scan can be saved to a format that can be imported into MSF for vulnerability detection and exploitation.

***

**PRACTICAL**
* `nmap -Pn -sV -O [IP] -oX [output_file_name]`
* **Importing nmap scan results innto MSF console**
    * Make a new workspace
      * `workspace -a [name]`
     
    * Import the output file
      * `db_import [path to the file]`
     
    * Confirm that the file is imported
      * `hosts`
     
* Running an nmpa scan in MSF console
  * Inside a workspace: `db_nmap [options] [target_IP]`
  * No need to save the output as it will automatically be saved through postgresql inside MSF console.
