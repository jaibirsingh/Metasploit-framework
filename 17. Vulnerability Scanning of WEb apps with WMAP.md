## What is WMAP
* A web application vulnerability scanner used to automate web server enumeration and scan web apps for vulnerabilities.
* It is available as an MSF plugin --> Can be loadewd directly into MSF and is full integrated with MSF.

* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `setg rhosts [IP]`
* `setg rhost [IP]`
* `load wmap`
* `wmap_` --> All the commands that can be run with wmap.
* `wmap_sites -h` --> Documentation
* `wmap_sites -a [IP]~--> This will create site
* `wmap_targets -t http://[IP]/[Directory if any or leave empty to scan the root of the website]` --> Add the targets to be scanned later
* `wmap_sites -l` --> This will list the websites added in the previous step.
* `wmap_targets -l` --> Similar work as the last command
* `wmap_run -t` --> List all the auxiliary modules that can be used for exploitation based on the target system
  * Usage: wmap_run [options]
        -h                        Display this help text
        -t                        Show all enabled modules
        -m [regex]                Launch only modules that name match provided regex.
        -p [regex]                Only test path defined by regex.
        -e [/path/to/profile]     Launch profile modules against all matched targets.
                                  (No profile file runs all enabled modules.)

* `wmap_run -e` --> will run all the matching modules

* As we saw in the results to upload a file to the root (/) of the website, so we will try to target other folders if they are vulnerable:
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put`
  * `set path /[name of folder to be tested]/`
  * `set filedata [data]` --> Here can we put code for a payload
  * `set filename [new file name]`
  * `run` --> This will tell if a file was uploaded or not.
  * `curl http://[IP/[payload file name]` --> This is to check if the uploaded file present on the target IP.
