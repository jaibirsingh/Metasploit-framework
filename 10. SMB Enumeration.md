## What is SMB
* Server MEssage Block is a network file sharing protocol used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a LAN.
* SMB == port 45. Originally ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139.
* SAMBA == Linux implementation of SMB -- > Alllows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.
* **How MSF can be used to exploit SMB**
  * Auxiliary modules can be utilized to enumerate the SMB vedrsion, shares, users and thus brute-force attacks can be performed.
 
* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgrresql start`
* `msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `search type:auxiliary name:smb`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`
* ***
* `back`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/smb_smb_enumusers`
* `info` --> This will provide inof about the module in context
* `run` --> This will reveal all the users on the target.
* ***
* `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares`
* `run` --> This will list all the shares on the LAN of the target system
* In the realm of SMB (Server Message Block) shares, it's possible for a user's home directory or a directory specifically created and shared for that user's access to be represented as an SMB share.
* For instance, on Windows systems, when a user connects to a network share or remotely accesses a system, they might have their own home directory or a dedicated folder set up for their use.
* This folder or directory can be shared via SMB and named after the user. This allows the user to access their files or resources conveniently over the network.
* So, a user's account or a user-specific directory can indeed be represented as an SMB share, making it accessible to that user or other authorized users on the network.
* It's a common practice to create user-specific shares for ease of access and file sharing within a network environment.

* **Brute-force attack**
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login`
  * `set smbuser [user revealed from the previous modules]`
  * `set pass_file`
  * `run`
  * `exit`
  * `smbclient -L \\\\[IP]\\ -U [usernmae]` --> Lsit the shares after loggin in
  * `smbclient \\\\[IP]\\[name of the share] -U [username]
