# Entities of MSF Architecture
  ## 1.Libraries
        * Rex
        * MSF core
        * MSF Base

  ## 2. Interfaces
      * MSF console
      * MSF CLI
      * Armitage
      * Web

  ## 3. Modules (Lang. used: Ruby)
    * Exploit
    * Payload
    * Encoder
    * NOP
    * Auxiliary

  ## 4. Tools

  ## 5. Plugins

  ***
  ### What is an Exploit
  * A module that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability
  * Typically paired with a payload.

  ### What is a Payload
  * Code that is delivered  by the MSF and remotely executed on the target AFTER successful eploitation.
  * Eg: A reverse shell that initiates a connection from the target system back to the attacker. Payload is what gives us a reverse shell

  ### what is Encoder
  * Used to encode payloads in order to avoid Anti-virus detection.
  * Eg:  Shikata_ga_nai --> used to encode Windows payloads.

  ### What is NOPS
  * Used to ensure that size of the payload is consistent --> Ensures stability of a payload when executed.

  ### Auxiliary module
  * Used to perform additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration
  * A module that cannot be paired with a payload.

***

## Types of MSF Payloads
1. Non-staged payload
   * Sent to the target as is along with the exploit
  
2. Staged payload
   * Sent in two parts
   * FIRST PART: called STAGER --> To establish a reverse connection back to the attacker and download the second part of the payload (called STAGE) and execute it.
  
***
## Meterpreter payload
* Meta-Interpreter payload
* An advanced multi-functional payload
* Executed in memmory on  the target making it difficult to detect.
* Communicates over a stager socket --> providing an interactive command interpreter
* Facil;itates the execution of system commands, file system navigation, keylogging, etc.

## MSF FIle system structure
* **MSF Module Locations**
    * `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules`
 
* **User specified modules**
    * `~/.ms4/modules`
