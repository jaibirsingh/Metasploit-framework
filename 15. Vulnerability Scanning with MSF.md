## What is Vulnerability Scanning
* Process of scanning a target for vulnerabilities and verifying whether they can be exploited
* **Metasploitable3**
  * Developed by Rapid7 --> To demonstrate how MSF can be used to perform exploitation of a Windows system.
  * https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3
 
* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `setg rhosts`
* `setg rhost`
* `db_nmap -sS -sV -O [IP]` --> Execute nmap within the MSF
* `hosts` --> Will show all the targets that were targetted in that MSF.
* `services` --> We can search for the exploits for any of these services like:
* `search type:exploit name:Microsoft IIS`
* **Searchsploit**
* A command-line utility pre-packaged in MSF to search the Exploit DB for exploit.
* `searchsploit "Microsoft Windows SMB" | grep -e "Metasploit"` --> To filter the ones with the expression "Metasploit"
* `searchsploit "Apache Tomcat"`

* **Looking for smb vulnerabilities**
  * `search eternal blue` 
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/ms_17_010_eternalblue`
 
* **Plugin --> "metasploit-autopwn"**
  * Github: https://github.com/hahwul/metasploit-autopwn
  * It looks at the databases, services and applications of the target system provided
  * Download db_autopwn.rb file in our system: `#> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hahwul/metasploit-autopwn/master/db_autopwn.rb`
  * Now in msfconsole:
    * `db_autopwn` --> This will list all the tags that can be used with the command.
    * `db_autopwn -p -t` --> where -p=Select modules based on open ports,, -t=Show all matching exploit modules.
    * `db_autopwn -t -p -PI [port number]` --> To filter based on a port number
   
* **Analyze**
  * `analyze` -->
    * Will analyze the contents of the MSF DB, hosts and services --> then provide with a list of vulnerabilities that those particular services suffer from.
    *  This will analyze the IP set as RHOST.
   
  * `vulns` --> will also list the vulerabilities that can affect the system.
 
* Q: 1/1
Which one of the following MSFconsole commands is used to load a custom plugin?
* load db_autopwn
