# SSH
* Secure Shell ---> remote administration protocol that offers encryption
* The successor to Telnet.
* SSH == uses TCP port 22 by default.
* **How can SSH be exploited**
* Auxiliary modules can be used to enumerate and perform brute-force attacks.

* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgresql start`
* `msfconsole`
* `workspace -a [name]`
* `setg rhosts [IP]`
* ***
* `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version`
* `run
*  `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers`
*  `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
  * Here we can use the users with highest privileges from the list obtained from the previous module, just to make the brute force attack faster.
