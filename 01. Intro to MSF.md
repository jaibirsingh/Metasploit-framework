## What is the use of MSF
* An open-source (the codebase is publicly available on GitHub), robust penetration testing and exploitation framework used to automate every stage of the penetration testing life cycle.
* **World's lasrgest database of public and tested exploits.**
* Eg: Port scanning can be performed manually but it can be done with modules present in MSF.

## Terminology
* **Interface**: The tool used to interact with MSF. Eg: MSF Console.
* **Module**: Pieces of code that perform a particular task. Eg: An exploit.
* **Vulnerability**: Weakness or a flaw in a system or network.
* **Exploit**: A module used to take advantage of a vulnerability in a system, service or a network.
* **Payload**: Piece of code delivered to the target system by an  exploit with the objective of executing arbitrary commands or providing remote acces to the attacker.
* **Listener**: A utility that listens an incoming connection from a target.

## Process
* Exploit takes advantage of the vulnerability --->
* Drops payload on the target system -->
* It executes a netcat reverse shell command -->
* A connection is made to the listener -->
* And as a result, we get a rveerse shell on the target

## Metasploit Interfaces
1. MSF Console
    * Provides access to all the functionality of the MSF.
  
2. MSF CLI
   * A command line utility --->
   * Discontinued in 2015 and same funcionality was provided in MSFConsole
  
3. Metasploit Community Edition
   * A web based GUI of the MSF
   * Simplifies network discovery anf vulnerabilty identification
  
4. Armitage
   * A free java based GUI for MSF
   * Simplifies network discovery, exploitation and post-exploitation.
  

* **Extrazz**
  * What year was Metasploit officially released to the public? --> 2003
