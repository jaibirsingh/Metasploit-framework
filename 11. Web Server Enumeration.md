## What is a web server
* A software used to serve data on the web.
* It utilizes HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to facilitate communnication between clients and web servers.
* HTTP === Typically utilizes port 80

* **How MSF is used to exploit a web server
  * Auxiliary modules can be utilized to enumerate the version of a web server, HTTP headers, brute-force directories, etc.
  * Eg: Apache, Nginx, M<icrosoft IIS.
 
* **PRACTICAL**
* `service postgresql start`
* `msfconsole`
* `workspace -a Web_Enum`
* `setg rhosts [IP]`
* `setg rhost [IP]`
* `search type:auxiliary name:http`
* `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version`
* `run` --> this will give the version of web server
* ***
* `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_header`
* `run` --> IT will reveal the "CONTENT_TYPE" mentioning the language used to host the web server.
* ***
* **Robots.txt
  * File used to list the directories and files that should not be found by a web browser or any other application but are part of the website.
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt`
  * `run` --> This will reveal the "disallowed" files and directories
  * `curl http://[target IP]/[one of the disallowed directories]/`
 
* **Directory brute force**
  * So the directories accessed above thruogh the 'curl' command can be targetted htrough:
  * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner`
  *  One of the 'options' in this module will be "Dictionary" which will have list of the possible libraries which will be matched one by one
  *  `run`~--> This will reveal the directories matched against the directory names in "Dictionary"
  *  **To look into the list of files in these directories**
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir` 
    *  `set Dictionary /usr/share/wordlists/[can be used various lists of dictionaries available here]`
    *  `run`
 
  * **To login to get acces to these dirs and files**
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login`
    * `set auth_uri /[directory on which the authentication is enabled and we are trying to get access to]`
    * We will unset the "USERPASS_FILE" as we don't need it in this context because we got "USER_FILE" set:
    * `unset userpass_file`
    *  * `run` --> We might not find any matches with the current "user_file" and "pass_file", soo might have to change those:
    * `set user_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/namelist.txt`
    * `set pass_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/http_default_userpass.txt`
    * `run` --> We might not find any matches with the current "user_file" and "pass_file", soo might have to change to a different module this time.
    * ***
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/apache_userdir_enum`  --> This is to fetch the usernames on the web server, so that search can be narrowed down.
    * `back`
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login`
    * `echo '[user obtained from the apache_userdir_enum module]' > [file_name].txt`
    * `set user_file /root/[file_name].txt`
    * `run` --> This might not provide us a legitimate password.
   
  * **Extrazz**
    * List of modules that can be used to exploit a web server:
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/apache_userdir_enum
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/brute_dirs
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_listing
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/http_header
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
      * auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt
